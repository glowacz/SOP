**A collection of low-level programs using processes, threads, network sockets, pipes, FIFO queues, message queues, epoll.** <br />  <br />
The programs are my solutions for tasks from Operating Systems 1 and 2 subjects @ MiNI PW from academic year 2022/23. <br />  <br />
A Makefile to be used for compilation is provided for every lab in SOP1 and is the same for all programs in SOP2. <br />  <br />
The descriptions for the tasks are owed to the lecturers and shall remain private.
